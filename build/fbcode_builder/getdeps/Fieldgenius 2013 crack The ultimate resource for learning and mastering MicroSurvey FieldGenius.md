Then, restart your computer and make sure you are not connected to the internet. Next, run the setup file for Lumion 11 and follow the instructions. When the installation is complete, do not open Lumion yet. Instead, copy the crack file from the TPcrew folder and paste it into the Lumion 11 folder. Then, run the crack file and wait for it to finish. Now you can open Lumion 11, but remember to never connect to the internet while using it. If you want to use Lumion again later, close it first and disconnect from the internet before opening it again.
