## What is Vari Comp?
 
Vari Comp is part of the Premium Tube Series bundle by Native Instruments, produced in collaboration with Softube. It is an all-purpose compressor that can handle any type of audio material, from vocals and guitars to drums and synths. It has two modes: Compress and Limit. In Compress mode, it has a subtle compression ratio of 1.5:1, which gives a smooth and musical sound. In Limit mode, the knee and ratio adjust automatically in response to the input signal, ranging from 4:1 to 20:1, depending on the input level and threshold settings. This mode can be useful for more aggressive compression or limiting.
 
Vari Comp also has some features that make it stand out from other compressors. One of them is the high-pass filter in the detector circuit, which allows you to exclude low frequencies from triggering the compression. This can help you avoid pumping or breathing effects caused by bass-heavy sounds. Another feature is the external sidechain input, which lets you use another audio source to control the compression. This can be handy for creating ducking or de-essing effects. Finally, Vari Comp has a wet/dry knob that lets you blend the compressed and uncompressed signals for parallel compression. This can help you retain some of the original dynamics and transients while adding some punch and glue to your mix.

- **Vocals:** Vari Comp can help you smooth out vocal performances and add some warmth and presence to them. You can use Compress mode with a low threshold and a moderate attack and release to gently even out the dynamics. You can also use the high-pass filter to prevent low-end rumble or plosives from triggering the compression. If you want to add some more character or saturation to your vocals, you can increase the input gain and lower the output gain to drive the tube emulation harder.
- **Guitars:** Vari Comp can also enhance guitar sounds, whether they are acoustic or electric, clean or distorted. You can use Compress mode with a higher threshold and a faster attack and release to tame any peaks or spikes in your guitar signal. You can also use the high-pass filter to remove any unwanted low frequencies or hum from your guitar. If you want to add some more edge or bite to your guitar tone, you can increase the input gain and lower the output gain to create some subtle distortion.
- **Drums:** Vari Comp can also work well on drum tracks, whether they are individual hits or loops. You can use Limit mode with a low threshold and a fast attack and release to control the dynamics and add some punch and snap to your drums. You can also use the high-pass filter to avoid compressing the low-end too much, which can make your drums sound thin or weak. If you want to add some more body or weight to your drums, you can increase the input gain and lower the output gain to make them sound fuller and louder.
