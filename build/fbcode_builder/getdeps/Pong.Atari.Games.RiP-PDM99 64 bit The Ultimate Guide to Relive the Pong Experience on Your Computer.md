Pong is considered to be the game that launched the video game industry. It was inspired by an electronic ping-pong game called Tennis for Two, which was created in 1958 by William Higinbotham. Pong was designed by Allan Alcorn as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell wanted to create a game that was easy to understand and play, but also challenging and fun.
