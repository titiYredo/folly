# How to Install Ss Ufs Android Patch on Your Smartphone
  
If you are looking for a way to boost the performance and storage of your Android smartphone, you may have heard of Ss Ufs Android Patch. This is a custom patch that modifies the system files of your device to enable UFS 3.0 support, which is a flash memory standard that offers faster and more efficient data transfers than eMMC.
  
UFS 3.0 is the latest iteration of Universal Flash Storage, a storage standard designed for smartphones and digital cameras. UFS offers read and write speeds that are significantly faster than eMMC (embedded MultiMediaCard) while retaining the same power consumption figures. UFS can do this as it is a full-duplex standard, meaning it can read and write data simultaneously. By contrast, eMMC can only read or write data at any given time[^4^].

UFS 3.0 introduces sizeable gains in performance from UFS 2.1, with the standard now offering sequential reads of 2,100MB/s and writes of 410MB/s. And when you pit it against eMMC 5.1, there's a 6x increase in random read and an 8.5x increase in sequential reads[^4^]. That means you can enjoy faster app loading, smoother gaming, and seamless 4K video playback on your smartphone.
  
However, not all smartphones support UFS 3.0 by default. Some devices may have the hardware capability but not the software support. That's where Ss Ufs Android Patch comes in. This patch is a modded version of the system files that enables UFS 3.0 support on compatible devices. It was created by a developer named Ss Ufs attebav, who shared it on Bitbucket[^1^].
