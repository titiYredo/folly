If you are a 3d artist who works with landscapes and environments, you know how challenging it can be to create realistic terrains and roads from scratch. You need to model the terrain shape, apply textures and materials, add details and vegetation, and make sure everything looks natural and seamless.
 
But what if there was a plugin that could help you generate topographically accurate terrains from a set of splines and lay roads over them in just a few clicks? A plugin that could save you hours of work and give you more creative control over your landscapes?

That plugin is Spline Land, a powerful tool for spline based terrain modeling in 3ds Max. In this article, we will show you how to use Spline Land to create stunning terrains and roads for your 3d projects.
  
## What is Spline Land?
 
Spline Land is a plugin for Autodesk 3ds Max that helps to generate topographically accurate terrains from a set of splines and lay roads. Without Spline Land, it is almost impossible to achieve such accurate results in 3ds Max. Now you can do it quickly, in just a few clicks your topographical data in form of splines can become a terrain[^1^].
 
Splines can be topographic contours in one plane each, or can be just any shape. You can use any types of splines, including open splines. Spline Land has a powerful algorithm that allows you to control the level of detail only in areas you need, just by adding or subtracting splines in that particular area, without overloading the whole scene[^1^].
 
With Spline Land, you can also lay roads over the terrain as well as create and level areas, generate bedding courses and ground cuts at selected angles and heights. You can assign ID to various terrain details and control the grid density[^1^].
  
## How to Use Spline Land?
 
To use Spline Land, you need to have 3ds Max 2014 or higher installed on your computer. You can purchase Spline Land from [here](https://icube3d.com/splineland.html) or download a trial version from [here](https://icube3d.com/splineland_trial.html). Once you have installed the plugin, you can find it under the Create panel > Geometry > iCube R&D Group > SplineLand.

1. Create or import splines that represent the contours or shapes of your terrain. You can use any type of spline, such as line, circle, arc, helix, etc. You can also use splines from other sources, such as CAD files or GIS data.
2. Select all the splines and click on the Create Terrain button in the Spline Land interface. This will generate a mesh that follows the shape of the splines. You can adjust the parameters of the mesh, such as height scale, grid size, smoothing angle, etc.
3. If you want to add roads or other features to your terrain, you can use the Road tool in the Spline Land interface. This tool allows you to draw splines over the terrain and automatically apply Path Deform modifiers to them. You can adjust the parameters of the road, such as width, height offset, twist angle, etc.
4. You can also use the Area tool to create flat areas on your terrain, such as parking lots or building foundations. This tool allows you to draw splines over the terrain and automatically level the mesh inside them. You can adjust the parameters of the area, such as height offset, slope angle, etc.
5. You can also use the Cut tool to create ground cuts on your terrain, such as trenches or ditches. This tool allows you to draw splines over the terrain and automatically cut the mesh along them. You can adjust the parameters of the cut, such as depth offset, slope angle, etc.
6. Once you are happy with your terrain and roads, you can apply materials and textures to them using standard 3ds Max tools. You 8cf37b1e13
