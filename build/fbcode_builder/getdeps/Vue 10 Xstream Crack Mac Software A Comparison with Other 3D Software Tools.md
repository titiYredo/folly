Some of the features that make Vue 10 Xstream stand out are:
 
- Spline and Road Tools: You can use splines to control various aspects of your scenes, such as EcoSystems distribution, terrain effects, object placement, and animation paths. You can also use the built-in road construction tool to draw roads directly onto your terrains and automatically adjust the terrain surface and texture to match.
- Dynamic Rocks: You can use the library of dynamic rock templates to create single rocks or groups of rocks with different shapes and sizes. Each time you use a template, Vue generates a new and unique variation of the rock. You can also edit the rocks manually or use them in EcoSystems.
- Physical Water: You can create realistic water surfaces with the new physical water shading engine that simulates light absorption and scattering in water. You can also adjust the water color, murkiness, reflectivity, and waves. Vue 10 Xstream also supports underwater rendering and godrays.
- Render Stack and Comparison: You can easily compare different renders of the same scene using the new render stack feature. You can also apply post-processing effects to each render and see the results in real time. The render stack preserves all the information of each render so you can fine-tune them later.
- Improved Rendering Performance: You can enjoy faster rendering times with Vue 10 Xstream thanks to the optimized internal scene processing and the support for multi-core and network rendering. Vue 10 Xstream also supports 64-bit versions of Windows and Mac OS X for better memory management.
