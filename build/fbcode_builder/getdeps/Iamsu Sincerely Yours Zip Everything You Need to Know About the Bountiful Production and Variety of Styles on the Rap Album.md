Sincerely Yours was originally released on May 13, 2014, by HBK Gang and Warner Music Group's Alternative Distribution Alliance. The album received positive reviews from critics, who praised Iamsu!'s production skills and catchy hooks. The album also featured guest appearances from 2 Chainz, Wiz Khalifa, Too Short, E-40, Berner and Sage the Gemini, among others.
 
Iamsu! described the album as an autobiographical concept album, saying "I wanted it to sound like one of those classic Aftermath albums, like the first album on the label that Dr. Dre puts out for an artist." He also said he wanted to show his versatility as a rapper and a producer, as he handled most of the production himself along with other members of The Invasion, Tha Bizness, Jake One, Trackademicks and Chase N. Cashe.
 
Sincerely Yours 1.5 is available for download on iTunes[^2^] and streaming on SoundCloud[^3^]. Fans can also check out Iamsu!'s Wikipedia page[^1^] for more information about his career and discography.
  
The album received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised Iamsu!'s production skills and catchy hooks. Pitchfork gave the album a 6.0 out of 10, saying "Iamsu! remains a distant figure on Sincerely Yours, but there's a charm in the constant amazement he expresses regarding his success thus far. Furthermore, his ruminations on unrequited love lack expected bitterness, as he instead seeks to understand his complicated feelings."[^1^]
 
AllMusic gave the album four stars out of five, saying "Falling somewhere between the mainstream rap-pop beats of Top 40 rappers like Drake and the hyphy influence of Iamsu's California roots, the album wanders between happy-go-lucky rap ballads like \"Girls\" and more club-friendly tracks and even the jazzy hybrid beat of \"Ascension.\"[^2^]
 
Rate Your Music gave the album an average rating of 3.5 out of 5, based on 15 user ratings. One user commented "Sincerely Yours is masterpiece that never got the credit/respect it truly deserved to get, it had slaps, thought provoking tales of his come up, and even had a deluxe edition, which added even more richness to a already very solid effort."[^3^]
