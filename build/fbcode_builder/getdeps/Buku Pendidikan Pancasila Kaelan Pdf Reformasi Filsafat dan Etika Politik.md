Pendidikan Pancasila is a subject that teaches the values and principles of Pancasila, the official ideology of Indonesia. Pancasila consists of five sila or precepts: belief in one God, just and civilized humanity, unity of Indonesia, democracy guided by wisdom, and social justice for all. Pendidikan Pancasila aims to instill these values in the students and citizens of Indonesia, as well as to foster a sense of national identity and patriotism.

One of the most popular and authoritative books on Pendidikan Pancasila is written by Prof. Dr. Kaelan, M.S., a lecturer at the Faculty of Philosophy of Gadjah Mada University. His book, titled Pendidikan Pancasila, was published by Paradigma in 2002 and has been widely used as a reference and textbook in various educational institutions. The book covers the historical, philosophical, ethical, and political aspects of Pancasila, as well as its relevance and application in the contemporary context.
 
In his book, Kaelan traces the origin and development of Pancasila from the ancient kingdoms of Kutai and Sriwijaya to the modern era of reformasi. He also analyzes the structure and meaning of each sila and how they form a coherent and harmonious system of thought. He argues that Pancasila is not only a state ideology but also a way of life that reflects the cultural diversity and pluralism of Indonesia. He also discusses the challenges and opportunities that Pancasila faces in the globalized world, such as human rights, democracy, corruption, terrorism, and environmental issues.
 
If you are interested in learning more about Pendidikan Pancasila and its significance for Indonesia's nation-building and development, you should definitely read Kaelan's book.
